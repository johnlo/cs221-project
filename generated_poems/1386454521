My hair had hardly covered 
my forehead. I was picking 
flowers, playing by my door, When you, 
my lover, on a terrace, with 
a lemon tree.....Oh, at last, when 
you return through the three Pa districts, 
Send me a message home ahead! And 
I will come back from Richmond and 
then you can smooth out the paper and 
you will be my daughter Tom, will you 
let me love you in your restaurant? 
I will tell you all. I want to 
go nowhere with you & I cannot 
bring myself  to toss the cup of cold 
coffee you set down by the door on 
your way to the Superdome, or to 
the hospital, or to the hospital, 
or to the hospital, or to the people 
in those condos, getting them all 
out of there and going back. Buses 
going back again, buses leaving 
out New Orleans again. That’s how 
it was. It was something to 
let him go. It was something 
to let him go. It was Sunday. 
The telephone rang, then stopped, then 
rang again. By the end of the day, I 
ran. The worst for us: the hospital, or 
to the hospital, or to the people in 
those condos, getting them all out 
of there. Every day they was 
moving us around, go here, go 
there, the buses is gonna meet you 
here, meet you there. They didn’t cover 
him up or nothing and the next day
