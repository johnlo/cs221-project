Watching the spectacular sunset, 
She turns to me and set Me free thereafter 
to the feral dark, and then throwing 
myself over my love— I 
hate to be the inspector of the world, I 
want to be able to like them. I 
sleep. Wake. “Justin’s your boyfriend?” I 
whisper to Brianna. My cell 
phone rings, screen says it’s my husband. 
If I want to spend a lot but 
not all of my years with you. We’ll 
talk about kids but make plans to 
travel. I will pick up your damp 
towel from the bed, and then we will race 
to your bedroom. I will always 
be the same and you will have a piece of 
me as well as the sun Tom, it’s so nice 
To slip upon the sliding ice. A 
chicken soup for the protection of 
others. A prayer to chicken soup
