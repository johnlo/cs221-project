I got married to 
get my wolf ways back, 
mate for life, duck and 
cover. The drums don't stop, 
the wolves crash through the front 
door, some with black and 
white fur, some with black 
and white fur, some with 
black and white, will bloom 
awhile, then wither. 
You petal, inch by 
inch. You turn red and 
white, will bloom awhile, 
then wither. You sit 
in an unlit room 
and watch the people with me? Yes, 
and we were strong-limbed 
and browning, and back. 
I went down and down. 
I think the wife might need 
some fine-tuning, 
some elbow grease, some 
wrenching apart, and 
then I won’t. I won’t 
be as hot as I was
