I walked down to the highway for, 
through the summer dawn, was the wife ever 
a shepherdess? Does she want to take

I’m glad I thought of you and glad 
you came. With my bursitis, I 
can’t do much these days. Strong enough 
last week to tug the pullcord of my 
saw, I walked across the woodyard, 
and breathed the blue fumes the chainsaw 
belched, listening to the pinging 
wind bells, thinking of the twelve years of 
wanting, apart and together
