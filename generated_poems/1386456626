You are the kind of person who 
buys exotic fruits leaves them 
out on the counter until they 
rot You always mean to eat them 
sometimes you rearrange them 
rousing over the bowl a cloud 
of scattered particles now, 
islands of shaving foam slowly 
spiraling down the drain, blood drops 
stippling the water pink as I 
kiss the back of your neck and then 
I will lick the salt off it. Then 
I will leave my shirt for you to 
sleep in so that always at night 
you will be pressed up against the 
thought of me Tom, if I weep and want 
to wait until you need me will you 
promise that someday you will 
need me? No, but later you can lie 
against me and almost touch me and when 
I walked slowly on toward 
them, instead of living out some 
winter wonderland Bobsey Twins 
fantasy, who were in constant 
wide-blue-eyed bewilderment
