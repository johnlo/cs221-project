These words: take refuge. What I adore 
is not horses, with their migraine-prone 
temples and introverted dispositions, loyal to 
a few memories that held out little 
hope, who still bought flowers, 
and with a smile the half-compassion and 
half-horror we feel for the creatures we 
want not to hurt and prefer not 
to touch Your first thought when the 
light snaps on and the black wings 
clatter about the kitchen is a bat 
the clear part of your mind considers 
rabies the other part does not consider 
knows only to startle and cower away 
from the bald, pale soul
