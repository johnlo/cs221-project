Peers back in. If they 
love, it is solely 
to be adored, it 
is to scatter and 
gather Themselves 
like hard seeds in a 
field made fallow by 
a fire someone years 
ago set. In the pulp 
of shadow and space, 
water sucked our 
people from sleep. Thatâ€™s how 
it all began and 
scrambled out at last 
onto land tingling 
with bramble and branch. 
And you were there, and 
we can even go the long 
way past the jungle gym. I 
will be deep water too
