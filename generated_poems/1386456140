At home, he’ll sleep, big boy between 
his parents, till he’s sure no beast 
will tear into his dreams. And we had 
to sleep in the streets. Cause the sidewalks 
was full of urine and body 
waste, dead bodies. I walked from 
water up to my neck to get 
to the Convention Center, the buses 
is coming, the buses is gonna 
meet you here, meet you there. They was 
on a hunt to kill. They killed 
one guy right there in front of us 
and kept going! The people was there to kill 
us. We do the same to them. I hate to 
say the spring. It's become bone-deep 
routine. Nice going, May, permission 
or bluster, even the unluckiest. 
Throw in the pasta, I'm on my way 
to her parents’ house she was waiting 
with her arms crossed trying not to 
look upset I think she thought she was going 
to be late picking Nancy up if 
I didn’t get a move on so I 
snipped off the best stems and hurried 
back down to my Ford I sped through 
every stop sign on my way 
to her parents’ house she was waiting
