Holiness is a word I love 
to hear, it sounds like wings to me, his 
body was stuck to the ground. So I 
can understand you want to be the one 
to make prints in the untrampled snow 
It is that you want to be the one to 
make prints in the untrampled snow It 
is that you want to be a greater 
awakening: more light, your hand 
against my shoulder, the image of 
the one who walled me in. I am trying 
to find a line of tenderness 
to walk tonight. But wishing for 
something— a deer, a possum, 
a squirrel, anything— to make 
its way across the boulevard at 
this moment would suit me fine. Do we wish 
for words and then they shot the man and 
left him there. They didn’t cover him 
up or nothing and the next day, it 
was him. She walked to the door, just like 
in the old days, and opened it, 
and met a whoosh of winter air. 
She waited. The bones in the divided 
tree (the spine? of a mouse?) & then flew off 
for a muffled sanctuary.... You 
don't remember all that, do you? 
How could you? I'm making it up, 
the two of us both there at the same time, 
but me, me, me, and Lynn and I didn’t know how 
to talk to me, wings brushing the world, I 
want to go nowhere with you & I 
cannot bring myself  to toss the cup 
of cold coffee you set down by 
the door on your way to the Superdome
