Ecchoing Green. Old John, 
with white hair Does laugh 
away care, Sitting 
under the oak, Among 
the old folk, They laugh at 
our play, And soon they 
all say. â€˜Such, such were 
the joys. When we all girls & boys, 
In our youth-time were 
seen, On the darkening 
Green. The sun is barely 
Over the trees, that the trees 
howl and howl it to 
the leaves. If you look 
at the word colony 
far enough, you see 
it traveling back 
to the dance floor, a beer 
in her hands. Disco 
drove the word away but 
it came back: Bulldyke, 
Bulldagger. What did 
the word want with me, and when 
he judges himself to 
be clean, I turn off the tap
