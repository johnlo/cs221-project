I have left you. That is how you 
shall love me in my restaurant Tom, 
will you climb on top of the dumpster 
and steal the sun for me? It’s just hanging 
there and I want it. No, but I 
will come inside you and you will 
have a piece of me as well as the sun 
Tom, it’s so hot here, and wait for 
the day lilies To open. The sun does 
descend, And our sports have an end: 
Round the laps of their mothers, Many 
sisters and brothers, Like birds in 
their nest, Are ready for rest; And 
sport no more seen, On the darkening 
Green. The sun is barely Over the trees, 
and already The sprinklers are out, 
Raining their immaculate Bands 
of light over the lawns. I could clean 
The garage, weed the garden, and a candle 
burnt a sore spot on my finger, 
and I bent my head on the painted 
woodwork, and wept. I want now to 
be close to you. I was grown before 
Two-Mama told me that as a kid 
he'd back up to a giant tree. 
I had to hate her; then I had 
to hate her; then I had to stop
