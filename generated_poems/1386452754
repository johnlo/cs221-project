Creature can lean its forehead into 
my hand. Fist my mind in your hand. What are 
you now? I will grab you under your wolf 
arms, feed you the warm soup. The wolves are downstairs 
with turntables and old speakers trying to 
connect the red wires to the triangle of the moon. 
They howl at it, carving this surrender 
so fluidly you expect the impossible: 
for her tang to swell up, ripe as seafoam, 
from the couch, from the rug, where I had watched you 
go, Were hidden, every one of them 
means any good to sheep. On the other hand 
goats, forgetting their native caution, come 
when they're called and even learn to nibble 
out of your skin Because, like I said, I 
never in my life grew up in a house 
with millions of people. You know, I’ve always 
had my own room, my own, I was certain, 
it would be too late to get inside and have 
a look around. It was suddenly night 
and I thought I’d pluck a few trumpets to 
bring your Grandma so I pulled our red 
ladder out of  the garage and climbed to 
the roof I stood up and imagined I 
was balancing the moon on my head the narrow 
windows of  Union Station gleamed like 
ice chips and the thin faces of the clock tower 
told me it was almost eight I was going to 
be late picking Nancy up if  I didn’t get 
a move on so I snipped off the best stems
