I feel the fleeting 
texture of your skin 
Because, like I said, 
I never in my 
life. Sometimes 
I speculate On 
what a tragedy 
his life was, really. 
: Take my hand. Speak to 
me. Take my hand. The word came 
after me, then hid each 
time I turned to 
look at it. We howl at 
it, from the gulf of her 
flushed and falling 
figure. Perhaps this 
is how God comes 
to us, or should come 
to us as He did to 
Teresa? A saint 
on her backâ€” a girl 
tearing open the gift 
He gave her? No need to 
wish for C.O. or 4-F. Oh 
thank you, Jesus God
