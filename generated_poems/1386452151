And soon they all say. 
â€˜Such, such were the joys. When 
we all girls & boys, In our 
youth-time were seen, On 
the darkening Green. The sun 
does descend, And our 
sports have an end: Round 
the laps of their mothers, 
Many sisters and 
brothers, Like birds in 
their nest, Are ready 
for rest; And sport no 
more seen, On the Ecchoing 
Green. Old John, with white 
hair Does laugh away
