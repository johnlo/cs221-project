I used to be a plastic bottle 
I used to be a radiant 
ingredient I used to 
be epic spittle, aka septic piddle 
I used to be a pleasant red 
colleague I used to grab 
on Dandy’s neck before he hauled 
me up and forward, white flanks flecked 
green with shit and the satin of his 
dander, the livingness, the warmth of all 
that blood just under the skin and in 
the long, thick muscle of the neck— He was smarter 
than most of the children I went to 
school with. He knew how to announce 
through violence how he didn’t hunger
