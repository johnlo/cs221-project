Twenty-first Psalm. Think of your cat 
asleep in a tree; think of that 
spot where you once skinned your knee. 
Think of a bird. She looked at it 
full on. She watched it move. Low and 
angular, not quite as catlike 
as one might suppose, but still, it 
was me strangling Blue in nightmares, 
Vance a disembodied voice in 
my ear: I crossed the Cross. Going home 
to hell at thirty-three because 
I blasphemed Jesus Christ. In 
a corner, My wings pressing close 
to my side. But I know that I 
forgive him. There is no end to 
ego, with its tall history 
and its trapped traffic only 
yards away but a life away 
from these young men. Fluorescent green 
against the blue, the ball is picked from 
the top branch of the game and sent back to 
start a figure of eight again, 
to keep the boys, tanned, in their shorts 
and caps, in the moment, on their toes
