God comes to us, or should come 
to us? Do we wish for words and then 
they come to us, all: the bluntly and 
beautifully corporeal 
at prayers in the Sunday school of 
pleasure. Why shouldn’t He come to us? Do 
we wish for words and then they come to 
us? Do we wish for words and then they 
come to us, or should come to us? 
Do we wish for words and then they come 
to us, or should come to us, or 
should come to us? Do we wish for words 
and say the opposite of what we mean? 
Syntax has never eaten from 
my hand. Fist my mind in your hand. 
What are you on? Who wants to kill 
me, Mom. His voice is flat. He knows the months he’s 
tried to woo this dog were over 
when it leapt for his throat and caught 
his mouth. The scars, at least, will be thrown out. 
Day by day, the water lowers. The red- 
and-white heads droop, blacken at the stems. 
It doesn’t matter. It’s a pleasure 
to feel the green nubs stripped, watch 
the stems refresh under your blade. They’re 
here because they’re beautiful. 
They glow inside your crystal vase
