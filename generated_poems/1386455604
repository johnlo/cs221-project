will come back from Richmond and then 
you will know Tom, will you come to 
my empty beige apartment and 
help me set up my daybed? Yes, and 
we taught her how to wait, how to watch, 
how to watch, how to watch, how to 
watch, how to watch, how to watch, how 
to watch, how to watch, how to watch, 
how to watch, how to watch, how to 
watch, how to watch, how to watch, how 
to watch, how to watch, how to watch, 
how to watch, how to watch, how to 
watch, how to watch, how to watch, how 
to watch, how to watch, how to watch, 
how to watch, how to watch, how to 
watch, how to watch, how to watch, how 
to watch, how to watch, how to watch, 
how to watch, how to watch, how to 
watch, how to watch, how to watch, how 
to be held, in that almost sacred 
very moment of straining, that 
happy haste sooner or later, 
M is also for mercy, mercy 
we can't live forever, mercy we have
