Square uncamouflaged? Dyke had a spike 
in it, touching my hands 
to the greening tips or tearing 
the yellow stalks back, so 
wild the living and the dead 
both snap off in my hands? 
The neighbor with his broken 
love: each comes up my drive 
to receive his pitying, accustomed 
consolations, watches me work in 
silence awhile, rises in anger, 
walks back. Does it 
offend them to watch me not 
mourning with them but working fitfully, 
fruitlessly, working the way 
the bees work, which is 
why there are no scape-sheep wandering 
the wilderness for our sins. 
No sheep would ever say, 
or, all right, think 
"The shepherd is our Lord." 
They are not good with metaphors 
but, stupid as they may 
be, they know that the 
shepherd sooner or later will come 
with his curved knife and the 
sheep always run whenever they see 
him. They run from his 
dog too, because it bites, 
but neither one of them 
means any good to sheep. 
On the other hand things keep
