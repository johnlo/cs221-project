I would have leapt. I am trying to 
remember the lyrics of old songs 
I’ve forgotten, mostly I am 
trying to remember one-hit 
wonders, hymns, and musicals like 
West Side Story. Singing over 
and over what I can recall, 
I hum remnants on buses and 
in the absence of you. I have to 
kill it, will it dead. Or so I 
thought until I passed a cycle 
on my own. You’ve no idea what’s 
grown inside me since I bled. When you 
were in New York I could see you 
in real life walking in my mind
