In breaks they see through (there there) 
The tiny women do not walk on 
air They tread light The tiny women 
do not walk on air They tread light 
The tiny women muster green, leaf 
They do not celebrate more They 
will not hill or pillow The tiny 
women do not walk on air They 
tread light The tiny women do not 
walk on air They tread light The tiny 
women do not walk on air They 
tread light The tiny women muster 
green, leaf They do not celebrate 
more They will not hill or pillow 
The tiny women muster green, leaf
