You don't remember all that, do 
you? How could you? I'm making it 
up, the two of us both there at the same 
time, but me, me, me, me, me, and Lynn and I didn’t know 
how to talk to her, my mother 
didn’t know how to talk to her, my 
mother didn’t know how to talk to 
me, his body was stuck to the ground, we’d 
have to beat and beat him with a 
police car and then they come to 
us? Do we wish for words and then they 
shot the man and left him there. They was 
lying. They was lying. There was the time I 
got there, I was certain, it would 
be to halve a sound that travels out
