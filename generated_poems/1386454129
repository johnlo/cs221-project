Likely as not, you leave it where 
it was. It was a long-ish drive 
for us of a Sunday, but not 
a handsome one. She drew a lion for 
me once before, on a terrace, with 
a lemon tree....Oh, at last, when 
you return through the three Pa districts, 
Send me a message home ahead! And 
I will come back from Richmond and 
then you will know you are even 
memory of events you know 
define who you are Though you know 
you're not the "you" you know you are my 
baby Tom, I am sitting on 
my dirt bike on the deck. Will you come 
out from the kitchen and watch the people with 
me? Yes, and then I will lick the salt off 
it. Then I lost my wolf ways back, 
mate for life, duck and cover. The drums 
don't stop, the wolves crash through the front door, 
some with black and white fur, some with 
black and white fur, some with black and 
white fur, some with black and white fur, 
some with black and white fur, some with 
black and white, will bloom awhile, then 
wither. You sit in an unlit 
room and watch the people with me? Yes, and I 
will put the screws in loosely so that 
when we move on it, later, it will 
rock like a cradle and then you can 
smooth out the paper and you will be my 
daughter Tom, will you come to my 
empty beige apartment and help 
me set up my daybed? Yes, and we were 
strong-limbed and browning, and back
