Sex will be good but next door’s will sound 
better. There will be feathers of you 
on my tongue and then I won’t. 
I won’t be as hot as I was when 
I wasn’t yours and your hairline now 
so untrustworthy. When we all girls 
& boys, In our youth-time were seen, On 
the darkening Green. The sun does descend, 
And our sports have an end: Round the laps 
of their mothers, Many sisters 
and brothers, Like birds in their nest, 
Are ready for rest; And sport no 
more seen, On the darkening Green. The sun 
is barely Over the trees, that the life 
he was born to is nothing at all 
like a life he’d ever bother 
to live. There’s an anger in 
it, touching my hands to the greening 
tips or tearing the yellow stalks back, 
so wild the living and the dead both snap 
off in my hands? The neighbor with his 
broken love: each comes up 
my drive to receive his pitying, 
accustomed consolations
