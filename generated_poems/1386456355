I sit up in bed And I sing 
and I sing. I wake in the morning 
early And always, the very first 
thing, I poke out my head and I 
sit up in bed And I sing and 
I sing. I wake in the morning. You 
have already made breakfast. Does 
your kindness feel oppressive? 
Does she agree with you that the coffee 
table? Does she agree with you that 
the coffee table? Does she want to take 
my information and told me he could 
send a crew next Tuesday. I hung 
up without leaving my number. 
I’m glad I thought of you and glad 
you came. With my bursitis, I 
can’t do much these days. Strong enough 
last week to tug the pullcord of my 
saw, I walked across the woodyard, 
and breathed the blue fumes the chainsaw 
belched, listening to it shriek 
as I touched the teeth to the sickliest 
tree. I had to hate her; then I 
had to hate her; then I had to 
hurt her; the rest of my life, I ate 
from her hand. The owl in the barn is so 
still No one takes my word that 
he is real. In the quiet woods, from the couch, 
from the couch, from the gulf of her flushed 
and falling figure. Perhaps this 
is how God comes to us, all: 
the bluntly and beautifully 
corporeal at prayers in the Sunday 
school of pleasure. Why shouldnâ€™t He come 
to us as He did to Teresa
