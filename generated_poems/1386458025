No sheep would ever say, or, 
all right, think "The shepherd is 
our Lord." They are not good 
with metaphors but, stupid as they 
may be, they know that the 
shepherd sooner or later will come with 
his curved knife and the sheep always 
run whenever they see him. They 
run from his dog too, because 
it bites, but neither one of 
them, under green moss, Hidden 
under moss too deep to sweep away. 
And the first autumn wind added 
fallen leaves. And now, in 
the Eighth-month, yellowing butterflies Hover, 
two by two, in our still 
dark house, and drove through Brooklyn’s 
deserted streets following trolley tracks to the 
bakery. There he’d change into white 
linen work clothes and cap, and 
in the absence of innocence. The 
marriage vow is a catchy tune that 
no one gets tired of, then 
it goes away into the basement to 
start a figure of eight again, 
to keep the boys, tanned, 
in their separate dwellings, their bodies 
Feel the next season come, they 
no longer have anyone to whom To 
tell it. Clouds of reverie
