I stood in a crowded street that 
was live with people, and no one at 
the gates of hell looks to grammar 
for help. Thus once more I'm saved 
by a power, a compassion 
employing the constellations, the mail, and 
the one who walled me in. I am not 
happy. I will conceal nothing. 
When I was seventeen I was 
a wolf. Then I lost my wolf ways 
back, mate for life, duck and cover. 
The drums don't stop, the wolves crash through the front 
door. O God. He wants to kill you? The sky 
wasnâ€™t black or blue but the dying green of 
night. Stars had closed their eyes or 
sheathed their knives. O God, I 
can neither go in or out. When 
I think about the Spanish friar 
who saw one of my grandmothers, 
two hundred years removed, and 
fucked her. If you keep still and 
do not speak, you might think again, 
about the barn you build, or roofing 
it with tin. It may be as close 
as an old man in Michigan
