I wake up, bound tightly. 
A warm, valerian 
smell cascades to my palate. 
I can wait longer 
than your grief. It 
is such a small thing 
to be proud of, 
a garden. Today there 
were scrub jays, quail, 
a woodpecker knocking at 
the white- and-black shapes of 
trees, and someoneâ€™s lost 
rabbit scratching under the barberry: 
is it indiscriminate? Should 
it shrink back, wither, 
and expurgate? Should 
I, too, not 
be loved? It is 
only a little time, 
a little space.
