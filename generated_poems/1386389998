Ana Only that 
I am not Ana, 
and the one who walled 
me in Has never had 
a dream in his life. 
He enclosed me in a 
wall ready made, In 
his own defensive 
wall So that I would 
be walking down the road you 
told me to imagine 
and I would and find 
a diner kind of 
teacup sitting on 
its saucer in the middle
