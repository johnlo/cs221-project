You can scratch, scratch, scratch, scratch, scratch, scratch, 
scratch, scratch, scratch, scratch, scratch, scratch, scratch, scratch, 
scratch, scratch, scratch, scratch, scratch, scratch, scratch, scratch, 
scratch, scratch, scratch, scratch, scratch, scratch, scratch, scratch, 
scratch, scratch, scratch, scratch, scratch, scratch, scratch, scratch, 
scratch but I stay underskin true 
to ebony, ink, crowberry, 
pitch; hoist me up by my hooves and 
shake till I'm shook, I'm still chock full 
of coke, fuliginous murk. O 
there's swart in my soul, freed. We all 
feel suspended over a 
drop into nothingness. Once you 
get close enough, you see what one 
is stitching is a human heart
