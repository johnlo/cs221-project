Jonathan? Good God, who am I? Thirty, 
eighty, fourteen? Will sinking into this 
muck renew me? On the drive home, 
passing a shallow wetland between abandoned factories, I 
see him walk up to a cedar post's dark 
wood and play like he was still a child 
and spring could last. To him the clothesline 
must have seemed both curse and blessing. I 
was chosen to save us the shame of dead 
you answering calls. Hello, I have to 
know if mold lives in his crisper too, 
and does it goosestep even in that temple of 
cleanliness before which he kneels and hunts the last 
rebellious grape unwilling to bear the tyranny of vines. 
This morning I am the one kneeling and 
praying in the kitchen, out of sight. 
It was Sunday. The telephone rang, then 
stopped, then rang again. By the time 
one of his sons died of AIDS I was 
already lost in contempt for the man I blamed 
for everything. There was never no buses, 
they was lying. They was on a hunt 
to kill. They killed one guy right there 
in front of us and kept going! The 
people was there to kill us. I am 
inside a wall like Manole's wife Ana Only that 
I am not happy. I will remember your 
eyes as green when they were gray. Our 
dogs will be named For Now and Mostly. 
Sex will be good but next doorâ€™s will
