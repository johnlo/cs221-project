The glass and salt my crooked pathway; 
impassable glass and salt. At 
the rise of the moon. They howl at it. We howl 
at it, from the gulf of her flushed 
and falling figure. Perhaps this 
is how God comes to us, or 
should come to us? Do we wish for words 
and then they shot the man and left him 
there. They was lying. They was on a 
hunt to kill. They killed one guy 
right there in front of McDonald's. 
She is clothed in white and, like them, 
is invisible to them. She is 
clothed in white and, like them, is 
invisible to them. I hate 
to invoke the seasons. They dismantle 
us. We do the same to them. I hate to 
invoke the seasons. They dismantle us. 
We do the same. I left my pack and no 
longer marked my earth. So I 
got married to get my wolf ways. 
I left a long time ago but 
he still remains haunted by the little boy 
who wanted to belong. Like him, 
I want to take your weed whacker 
through the house? Has she ever, in a week 
or two, will be invisible. At 
home, he’ll sleep, big boy between his 
parents, till he’s sure no beast will 
tear into his dreams. And we will sit 
Upon the rocks By shallow rivers 
Come live with me Before spring Swallows 
the air And birds sing Come live with me And 
we will sit Upon the rocks By shallow 
rivers Come live with me Before spring
