A Small Poem for James Wright by RICK CAMPBELL
One afternoon in thick fog and summer 
rain, I climbed out of a preacher's car 
near Parkersburg, draped

my orange poncho over me and drifted 
north like a bobbing traffic cone. 
I hitched your river road toward

Martin's Ferry where the beautiful 
autumn bodies threw themselves 
at each other in the suicidal lights.

I never made it that time. Night 
fell in Sistersville and an old woman 
who harbored runaways, kids whose

fathers beat them and suffered other 
sundry problems, called me off the street, 
gave me a meal and a place to sleep.

The next moming I said enough 
to homage and hitched into the valley 
and the refrigerator that waited for me there.

I knew where to find you. 
Time was still on my side.
