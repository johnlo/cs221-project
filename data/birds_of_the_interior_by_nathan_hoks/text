Birds of the Interior by NATHAN HOKS
On the side street of my heart 
In the control room of my silence 
In the landfill of my shadow

In the happenstance of the silo 
In the spirit of my laundry room 
In the water tower of my life

Below the watchtower of my social life 
In the fuse box of my empathy 
In the fuselage of my ire

Around the archipelago of my apathy 
Beneath the corkscrew of my libido 
Within the coalition of my slumber

Between the swagger of my oil tanks 
On the kite string of the image 
Behind the body armor of going on and on

In the cottage of my spectacles 
In the cabin of my speechlessness 
In the bondage of my voice box

In the cocktail of my inaccuracy 
In the cocktail of my appetite 
In the cocktail of a steady gaze 
In the cocktail of a steady gaze
