Babu Will Show You to Your Room by JULIE O'CALLAGHAN
    Ballynahinch Castle, September 2012


we follow Babu 
     he turns 
           we turn

he enters a corridor 
     with us behind 
           he trots down stairs 
                 we do the same

more turns 
     further hallways 
           through a lounge 
                 veering left 
                       around a corner

we wonder 
     how far more 
           Babu can 
                 lead us

is it possible 
     this journey 
           is never-ending?

we do not ask 
     we are Babu's followers: 
           holding hands

since that's what 
     Hansel and Gretel do 
           when they get nervous
