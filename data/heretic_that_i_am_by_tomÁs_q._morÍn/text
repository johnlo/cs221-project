Heretic That I Am by TOMÁS Q. MORÍN
Three days now the mold 
has advanced across the face 
of the peach I caught 
with one hand like Willie Mays, 
saving it from the sidewalk 
and its army of black shoes 
and how could it happen 
that my peach turned 
into Castro, the young one 
who regularly baptized 
the microphone and the first row 
of sleepy workers with his spit 
and anger and love. What is love 
if not a commitment to fatigues 
and I wonder if he wears sea green trunks 
to the beach or olive pajamas 
with padded feet? I have to know 
if mold lives in his crisper too, and does 
it goosestep even in that temple 
of cleanliness before which he kneels 
and hunts the last rebellious 
grape unwilling to bear the tyranny 
of vines. This morning I am 
the one kneeling and praying 
in the kitchen over the beard 
of my communist peach, how 
it's a second cousin of the hacky sack, 
albeit spongier, like a meatball, 
which reminds me the letter M 
is for Marx, and for moonshot, 
and for miracle. And sooner or later, 
M is also for mercy, mercy we have 
beauty, mercy we can't live forever, 
mercy we have time and rot 
to work our stubborn flesh away 
from the bald, pale soul 
that screams with joy when it pops up 
and free toward the first night 
of October in Indian summer.
