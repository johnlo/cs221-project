Poem by FRANK O'HARA
Here we are again together 
as the buds burst over the trees their 
light cries, walking around a pond in yellow weather.

Fresh clouds, and further 
oh I do not care to go! 
not beyond this circling friendship, 
damp new air and fluttering snow 
remaining long enough to make the leaves 
excessive in the quickness of their mild return, 
not needing more than earth and friends to see the winter so.

                                                                 [April 15, 1954]
