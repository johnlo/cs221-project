The Poets at the Ball Game by REGINALD HARRIS

                                             Fanaticism? No. Writing is exciting 
                                             and baseball is like writing. 
                                                   You can never tell with either 
                                                         how it will go 
                                                         or what you will do . . . 
                       â€”Marianne Moore, "Baseball and Writing" (1961)
are not used to such good seats: 
behind third base, a perfect view, 
outfield grass as green as Lorca's Verde 
que te quiero verde. They feel a bit like 
Miss Moore, honored by the Yankees in '68 
to toss out the first pitch,

dream of "Poetry Day at the Park": 
a personalized sonnet for the first 
one hundred fans and free haiku for kids. 
The crowd raps out rhythms with minibats, 
signed by the poet laureate, count iambs 
during the caesura of the seventh inning stretch, 
recite heroic couplets for the hitter who launches

a long fly beyond the upper deck, filled 
with visiting midshipmen, white uniforms a blur. 
They cheer with the sound of frothing waves, 
a thousand cranes in flight. 
A forest of blank pages tossed aloft.
