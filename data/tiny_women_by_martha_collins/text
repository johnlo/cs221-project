Tiny Women by MARTHA COLLINS
The tiny women 
muster green, leaf

They do not celebrate more

They will not hill or pillow

The tiny women slip 
under doors, window 
walls, disturb

They forage time, rest 
at attention, stir 
up stalled air

Together, they lift 
dust, ashes, build

In breaks they 
see through 
(there   there)

The tiny women do 
not walk on air

They tread light
