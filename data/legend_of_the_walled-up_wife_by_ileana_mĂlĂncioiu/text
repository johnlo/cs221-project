Legend of the Walled-Up Wife by ILEANA MĂLĂNCIOIU
I am inside a wall like Manole's wife Ana 
Only that I am not Ana, and the one who walled me in 
Has never had a dream in his life.

He enclosed me in a wall ready made, 
In his own defensive wall 
So that I would be neither inside his boundary 
Nor outside.

He dreams only now at last 
And moves to release me from the dry stone,
But he no longer knows where he walled me in.
