Dining with Hitler by WILL WELLS
In meals at Emma's, only children 
and grandchildren rated given names. 
In-laws owned a separate nomenclature. 
Abuse was served in equal portions 
with beef brisket and bloodied purple beets. 
Aunt Ellen was "the Greek." 
Aunt Rosalie was "the Blonde." 
German Uncle Dick was "that Dutchman."
And my gentle father was "Hitler." 
If Rosalie asked for dinner rolls, 
Emma would say, "Hitler took them, 
to the Blonde he should pass." 
It was more accusation 
than table manners. Prisoners 
of the failed detente called family, 
we stared at shame reflected in the borscht 
and ate fast. At least the food was good.

Sometimes Cousin Joyce would flip 
her long dark hair over her face to block out 
her mother's stricken wine-dark stare. 
And I'd sneak glances at my dad 
to catch, how in profile, he actually looked 
the part. When I substituted my thumb 
for a moustache, it was uncanny. 
And fury rose in his eyes like film-clips 
of Nuremberg speeches on The Twentieth Century 
narrated by "the Cronkite." After ice cream 
warmer than the atmosphere, he'd snatch me 
for a long drive through the rubber stench 
of eastern Akron till he was calm 
enough to chafe out the rest of the visit. 
Veteran of World War Two, comparison 
with what he'd battled to destroy 
doubled the insult. He'd shake his head, 
"You know if Hitler had caught her before 
she escaped, he would have shot himself sooner."
