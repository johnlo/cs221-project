How I Understand Eternity by BRIAN SWANN
Organisms evolved colors before 
    there were eyes to see them. 
I take a look before floating 
    to the Cretaceous where colors 
are now butterflies and beetles 
    shaping themselves to flowers 
of sassafras and magnolia. Their 
    scents fill my mind while night 
starts to warp round me and a 
    rabbit in the doorway pauses 
by a half-eaten apple. I watch 
    the lamplight's clear pool 
on the ancient pinewood planks 
    fall through cracks and knotholes 
onto the lives of mice as starlight 
    filters through the window 
and falls on me.
