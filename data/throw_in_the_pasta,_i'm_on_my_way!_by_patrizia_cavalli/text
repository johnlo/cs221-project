Throw in the pasta, I'm on my way! by PATRIZIA CAVALLI
Throw in the pasta, I'm on my way! 
O bliss, I'll be fed. 
But the water doesn't boil, not yet. 
For someone to be there bringing 
water to a boil and to get there on time 
before the pasta overcooks 
or God forbid grows cold, 
in that exact always slightly hysterical 
moment, yes, in that almost sacred 
very moment of straining, 
that happy haste sooner or later, 
will come to all, even the unluckiest.
