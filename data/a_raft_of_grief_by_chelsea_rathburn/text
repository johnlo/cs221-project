A Raft of Grief by CHELSEA RATHBURN
"The raft that means 'a great number' is not related at all to the
raft that carries people or their possessions in the water. The two
words are homonyms . . . " 
                   â€”Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins

If only there were a boat, 
low and long and loaded 
with all we'd brought or built: 
the fatal inattentions, 
anxieties and tics 
that time had sanctified, 
our good and bad intentions, 
rages, lapses, and aches. 
If only it were that easy, 
to stand only ankle- 
deep in the sullied water 
hoisting our shared cargo, 
sinking no further beneath 
its weight. If only the boat 
did not need a rower; 
we'd push it off together 
then wade to opposite banks 
absolved at last, forever, 
buoyant, watching it go.
