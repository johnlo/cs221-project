First Choral Ode of Bakkhai by EURIPIDES

Holiness 
is a word I love to hear, 
it sounds like wings to me, 
wings brushing the world, grazing my life. 
Pentheus has a harsh sound, 
a negative sound. 
He's a negative person. 
He's against Dionysos, 
against rejoicing, 
against laughter, 
against flutes. 
Not to mention the transcendent gladness of grapes and wine 
so beneficial to body, soul, and psyche's interior design.
I'm saying 
his tongue is unbridled, 
his reasoning reckless, 
his end may be hot and hard. 
A life of quiet discretion, 
still as a summer day, 
keeps the house cool. 
Far off in the air live the undying gods 
but they watch us. 
They watch how far we press our limits: 
there is a morning star, 
there is an evening star, 
don't press too far.

O daimon!
I dream of a perfectly clear afternoon 
on the island where Aphrodite sits 
counting her blessings 
by the erotic sea. 
I dream of rivers 
with a hundred mouths 
and mountains 
where the leaves turn over like silver fire. 
Take me there, Dionysos, 
take me 
some place ruled by the law of desire 
where we can dance you and dance you and never tire.

A person may be high, 
a person may be low, 
a person may be rich, 
a person may be simple, 
all the same 
Dionysos will wrap his arms around you. 
It's not about intellectual prowess, 
it's not about true and false, 
it's pure release. 
In Dionysos' nights and days you can find peace. 
Say no and he will hate you. 
Choose this embrace, 
I do.
