The Mind After Everything Has Happened by ROWAN RICARDO PHILLIPS
Perpetual peace. Perpetual light. 
From a distance it all seems graffiti. 
Gold on gold. Iridescent, torqued phosphors. 
But still graffiti. Someone's smear on space. 
A name. A neighborhood. X. X was Here. 
X in the House. A two-handed engine 
Of aerosols hissing Thou Shalt Not Pass 
On fiery ground. A shot-down Aurora 
Borealis. That raised areola 
At the tip of the tongue of I or Thou. 
Benedict Robinson, text me, if you know: 
If Hell is a crater to a crater 
To a crater to a crater, what then 
Is Heaven, aside from its opposite, 
Which was glorious, known and obvious?
