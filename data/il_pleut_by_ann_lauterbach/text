Il Pleut by ANN LAUTERBACH
And the ghosts of Galileo 
and Apollinaire

are meeting in a room 
reserved for those

in mourning for 
acts of insight

that link 
perception

to understanding. 
They inhale clouds

that promise a more 
thorough oblivion

than mere death. 
There's a knock at the

horizon. Someone 
has come to join them.

She is clothed in 
white and,

like them, is 
invisible to them.

She speaks slant 
lines only the birds hear.
