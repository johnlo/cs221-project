Isaac by DAVID R. SLAVITT
After that grotesque business up on the mountain, 
Abraham comes down and goes to Beersheba, 
but what about Isaac? 
                                     No, not a word about him.

A mistake? 
                    There cannot be mistakes in the Torah! 
The hole is there to let the rabbis fill it, 
to see through that emptiness the light of truth.

In study houses, then, those earnest old men 
told one another stories, made up midrashim 
to answer the question that loomed. Maybe he went 
out into the desert? Maybe out there he met 
Ishmael, and the half brothers compared 
their sad stories. And maybe reconciled? 
Or at least came to that delicate equipoise 
of civility relatives need to be together.

Another rabbi says that it's too much, 
that there's no need and therefore no warrant to go 
quite that far into the desert shimmer. 
Be sensible. Think! Where could he have gone? 
We need an answer. What would a young man do? 
Say he spends a year or maybe more 
at some yeshiva! 
                               Where would there be a yeshiva? 
Torah is eternal: although it had not 
yet been written, it had always been written. 
Its sacred fire always burned, like the bush 
God allowed Moses to see that does not 
consume itself and therefore burns even now. 
So if there was Torah, there were yeshivas, 
high in the sky, or perhaps just around the corner, 
though not yet visible. Maybe he studied there.

But who, then, could his teachers have been? 
                                                                         Us! 
And what would we have been doing until that moment? 
Waiting for Isaac, of course. 
                                              As we are still waiting.
