Dyke by ROBIN BECKER
The word came after me, then hid each time 
I turned to look at it. 
It breathed in the hedge. I could hear it bite 
and snap the air.

I feared the woman with slicked-back hair 
sitting on a bar stool, 
her back to the dance floor, a beer in her hands. 
Disco drove the word away

but it came back: Bulldyke, Bulldagger. 
What did the word want 
with me, and why this dread, this desire, this
dangerous butch

striding through Kenmore Square 
uncamouflaged? 
Dyke had a spike in it, a cleated surge. 
In leathers, the word leapt

18th century grillwork 
on the Boston Common and led the parade 
around the city, 
the slow, snaking, joyful, motorcade

of a new millennium. First 
I had to hate her; 
then I had to hurt her; the rest of my life, 
I ate from her hand.
