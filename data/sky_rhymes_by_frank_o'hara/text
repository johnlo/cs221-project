Sky Rhymes by FRANK O'HARA
If we are one 
in a single sun 
the stars below 
are weeping snow

our head is wheeling 
without ever feeling 
the interstellar 
mirror Dweller

the blind earth rolling
under His strolling 
's an axial log 
in a cloudless bog

          the Milky Way 
          is not very gay 
          a thickening path 
          a cool foot-bath 
                                                        [Ann Arbor, June 1951]
