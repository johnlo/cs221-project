Talking about the Wind by KATIE PETERSON
I hate 
to invoke the 
seasons. They

dismantle us. 
We do the same to them. 
I hate to say the spring. It's become

bone-deep routine. Nice going, 
May, permission 
or bluster, even the little

leaves that top 
the cottonwoods, 
you take

(shrunk coinage) you take 
charge and a share 
of everything, leaving the roots

and skeletons of these, who say
obscenities, they've 
been wanting

to say them to you all year, 
with what you've done, 
do now, and soon will. Opposites

I say, always the most 
taxing. That one tree 
without moving willing to walk

into the wind all by her heroic lonesome 
until my eyes move and her branches 
tie her to a sister next to her. Even

my winnowing self, which loves distinctions, 
confuses her with her. 
With these actions your world

takes off a layer from us. 
A hand mimes a knife drop, as practice. 
I'm close to nothing

all at once, and it makes 
small sense, as much as 
talking about the wind as an amount,

paid or refused. Or throwing my love 
as I always do 
over sleeping things, the slow, and what the wind

makes by blowing over,

and then throwing myself over my loveâ€”
