Stopping suddenly, no destination by PATRIZIA CAVALLI
Stopping suddenly, no destination
at the top of stairs 
that no longer led me anywhere 
I held the banister 
and raised my eyes. Ah what was 
the oval fervor of that portal, 
shut and absorbed in its condition? 
Like a foreigner I gaped at it 
my look now given to prayer 
the rest of my body slack 
rising like spirit to my mouth. 
To conserve the strength of my idea 
I sat down on the stairs 
and said aloud: "It's strange, it's strange. 
And I'm not leaving here until 
I understand. It's strange, so strange." 
But I got lost more violently 
in a white languor with no history 
a memory before all other memory 
like an original melange 
in which cells could wander 
that still had not agglomerated 
into the human present that we are. And finally 
empty of thought I nearly gave in 
fully to this broad nostalgia 
that took me far away with it 
and deprived me of my own chronology. 
But my heart's vile laziness 
that's only capable of superstition 
soon encased that impetus in a name 
and the spacious, nameless heat 
took the form and cold 
of its last shut refuge. 
And I found myself in the dark of love.
