Law by STEPHEN BERG
Easy to deny it's impossible to be who you are 
Though you know you're not the "you" you know you are 
even memory of events you know define who you are 
don't really prove it but prove who you are 
is at the mercy of a force you've never seen so you are 
not organized like a finch or squirrel whose lives are 
determined and true in unselfconsciousness while you are 
always sitting on the chair edge of your mind are 
worried ceaselessly by nothing in particular are 
the nameless hero of a future age whose virtues are 
imageless black and white negatives of faith a being so strong you are 
joyless cold and have no need are 
suffused finally with the banal godless knowledge that you are 
hopelessly unknown warped adrift gutted and are 
grateful for it because at least the humiliations are 
precise keys that fit real brass locks on doors behind which you are 
safe the word is safe & purge you of delusions shields 
fending off sorrow that you are 
the one whose inmost wish is to be here as you are
