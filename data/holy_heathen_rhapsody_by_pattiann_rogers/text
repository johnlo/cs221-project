Holy Heathen Rhapsody by PATTIANN ROGERS
As if underwater, she floats and shimmies 
slowly upward while the sun warms. She pauses 
to sink again through the green and deeper 
green garden leaves of this single tree, 
its edifice all of Eden, earth and paradise, 
slender branches bending and flowing 
with the morning currents.

Summer lolls, lingers in its own mazes, 
a white-limbed poplar, leafstalks, peel 
of scented bark. Her body—seed wing 
or feather down, thread slivers of silk—
touches each curled lobe and creviced branch 
as she passes, slides underside, overside, 
along the ridges and furrows. (Is that a tiny 
tongue finding the way?) Love is this sun-
holding tree of lapping leaves, delves, 
canopies, a multi-tangled cover.

A spasm of breeze, the tree shivers, each leaf 
twisting white flash/green shadow. By will 
or wind, she moves stemward toward the steady 
trunk, following fissure and tangent, rests 
finally folded in a woody niche. Who could 
know better? Regard the celestial; the sky 
is not shelter.
