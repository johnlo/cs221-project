On My Seventieth Birthday I Try to Skinny-dip in Boston Harbor by SANDRA KOHLER
I cover my nakedness this morning 
with an outsize purple tee, "Outrageous 
older woman" scrawled in pink across 
the chest. A gift from my son, daughter-
in-law. Beneath it, the only part of 
my body where my skin fits me still, 
unmarred by time—my shoulders.

Sunrise, ebb tide, half an inch of water 
covering Tennean Beach's pebbles, mud 
I sink into as soon as I step out toward 
dawning sun. Planning this baptism I 
forgot to check tide charts: I'd have to 
wade through seventy feet of muck to get 
my feet wet: no quick strip and dip here.

Turning seventy: I never imagined this. 
Years ago, when I'm visiting my eighty-
something mother-in-law, she's gossiping 
about a neighbor, calls her "an old lady" 
—stops herself, says, "I know I'm old 
too, but not inside." Inside, what age 
am I? Thirty, eighty, fourteen?

Will sinking into this muck renew me? 
On the drive home, passing a shallow 
wetland between abandoned factories, 
I see a flash of white: two egrets gingerly 
wading, stepping, spreading their wings 
in the risen light over a brood of hatched 
fledglings, as new as aging is to me.
