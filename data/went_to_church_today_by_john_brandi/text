Went to Church Today by JOHN BRANDI
Down flaked-obsidian nave, 
up snowpeak choir-loft overlooking 
wide sandy congregation 
from sky veranda:

winged seedlings 
          trembling in ascent 
plumes of tamarisk silky pink.

Can't say it enough 
    can't sing it enoughâ€”

This syntax of gulch, steep 
hummocky lava slopes, sun perfectly angled 
onto stained-glass altars 
          dancing with fireweed.

O praying mantis 
on prickly-pear bloom, Song of Songs 
I go to my knees, palms to earth, 
the whole Garden profuse 
as the gods 
    meant it to be.
