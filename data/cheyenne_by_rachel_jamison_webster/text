Cheyenne by RACHEL JAMISON WEBSTER
I went down and down. 
I swam beside the boat, 
near its sucking wake and tall 
dangerous sides. I pulled 
through water hung with mud and slick 
shale-stumbled banks running up to trees 
and scattered logs bleached white by the sun. 
The way I loved seemed to be confounding 
everyone. I was not alone, 
I had a friend I did not need language 
with as we paddled side by side. 
I was not shopping, scanning 
the horizon for what would be a better life 
but beside that ship of people 
being ferried safe within their deaths. 
We would all arrive at the same time, 
but me by my own rhyming muscle. 
I swam until the water grew warm 
as a body around my body, until I was 
in a liquid I had been before, I opened 
my eyes against the current 
and the stripping weeds, dragged myself 
ever deeper into the strands of the past, 
back to the riversplit where it all began 
and scrambled out at last onto land 
tingling with bramble and branch. 
And you were there, and we were 
strong-limbed and browning, and back.
