For One Whose Love Has Gone by BRENDA HILLMAN
          There was a crack 
    in ecstasy; it split the oak 
with flameless fire. 
A raptor left good bones 
in the divided tree (the spine? 
  of a mouse?) & then flew off 
     for a muffled sanctuary...

Some say get 
     over it, but there you are, 
surrounding it. Slant sun 
     shines in. Bring it along, 
bone-reader, bring the banquet.
